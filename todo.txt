1. Create a stack of cards.
	{
		The stack will be an array of 52 cards.
		Each card will be a string with the value and suit.
		for(let i = 0; i < 52; i++)
		{
			let value = i % 13 + 1;
			let suit = i % 4;
			let card = value + suit;
			stack.push(card);
		}
	}

2. Draw 2 cards for the dealer (one face up, one face down) and 2 cards for the player (both face up).
3. The player goes first. The player can choose to hit (draw another card) or stand (keep the cards they have).
4. If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose.
5. If the player stands, the dealer draws cards until they have 17 or more.

		3. Player has 21
		4. Dealer has 21
		5. Player has more than dealer
